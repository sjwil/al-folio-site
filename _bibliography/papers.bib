	abstract = {Existing multi-agent motion planners face scalability challenges with the number of agents and route plans that span long time horizons. We tackle these issues by introducing additional abstraction by interpolating agent trajectories with natural cubic splines and leveraging existing results that under some natural assumptions, the resulting game has the structure of a potential game. We prove a simultaneous gradient descent method using independent per-agent step sizes is guaranteed to converge to a local Nash equilibrium. Compared with recent {iLQR}-based potential game solvers, our method solves for local Nash equilibrium trajectories faster in games with up to 52 agents, and we demonstrate scalability to long horizons.},

	abstract = {Automatically constructing smooth paths that satisfy a formal specification is a challenging problem. Existing methods struggle to scale to long horizon specifications and challenging environments. We present a method that uses abstraction, model checking, and convex optimization to solve for a smooth Bézier spline that is guaranteed to satisfy a Linear Temporal Logic specification. Our approach uses a coarse abstraction to avoid the state explosion of other abstraction based methods, and successfully avoids the computational challenges of directly optimizing the non-convex temporal logic semantics. We prove our method is sound and complete and demonstrate a significant computational advantage relative to state of the art approaches. Generating such smooth paths has natural applications in path planning for autonomous robots, and we demonstrate the applicability of our method on path planning for a quadrotor.},

	abstract = {We present an algorithm to solve for local Nash Equilibrium trajectories in the multi-agent motion planning problem for self-interested agents. Our method models the problem as a concurrent game where each agent's action consists of choosing a cubic spline defined by a set of waypoints. We observe that with certain kinds of cost functions, the resulting game has the structure of a potential game which is guaranteed to reach an equilibrium even when each agent myopically improves their own cost without considering the costs of other agents. Our algorithm uses simultaneous gradient descent with independent per-agent step sizes to converge to local Nash Equilibrium trajectories. We demonstrate the algorithm can scale to very long horizons through simulated experiments in the electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles ({eVTOL}) domain.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a framework for training neural network ({NN})-based feedback controllers for autonomous agents with deterministic nonlinear dynamics to satisfy task objectives and safety constraints expressed in discrete-time Signal Temporal Logic ({DT}-{STL}). Control synthesis that uses the robustness semantics of {DT}-{STL} poses challenges due to its non-convexity, non-differentiability, and recursive definition, in particular when it is used to train {NNbased} controllers. We introduce a smooth neuro-symbolic computation graph to encode {DTSTL} robustness to represent a smooth approximation of the robustness, enabling the use of powerful stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation-based optimization for training. Our approximation guarantees that it lower bounds the robustness value of a given {DT}-{STL} formula, and shows orders of magnitude improvement over existing smooth approximations when applied to control synthesis. We demonstrate our approach on planning to satisfy complex spatiotemporal and sequential tasks, and show scalability with formula complexity.},

	abstract = {Self-triggered controllers have the potential to improve the state-of-the-art of Cyber-Physical Systems ({CPSs}) by enhancing the performance of the underlying closed-loop control systems. However, a major concern in deploying a self-triggered controller in a safety-critical {CPS} is that the stabilizing self-triggered controller may not always guarantee the satisfaction of the safety constraints. We propose a self-triggered control scheme that deals with the safe scheduling of control tasks for uncertain continuous-time linear systems. We derive a computationally efficient scheduling function that computes an upper bound on the next sampling period as a function of the current state in the presence of additive disturbance. To reduce the computational complexity of online reachability analysis and increase accuracy, we compute a large sequence of reachable sets offline and use these precomputed sets to derive a low-complexity online scheduling function that computes sufficiently large bounds in real time. We evaluate our algorithm on three high-dimensional benchmark control systems, where two of the examples have a twelve-dimensional joint state plus feedback input. Experimental results demonstrate that our self-triggered control algorithm guarantees the safety of the closed-loop control system through negligible online computation, establishing the feasibility of its practical implementation.},
